To execute the research projects undertaken, the scholars of the Centre are engaged in extensive field work like visiting libraries and academic institutions ,without which thorough and comprehensive studies would not be possible. It helps a lot in locating new source material ,of which the Centre has procured hard as well as soft copies for the library. The setting up of Sri Guru Granth bhawan with all its facilities will immensely benefit the mankind by helping it to imbibe its teachings into their lives,thereby making them spiritually enriched.Hopefully it will enrich the collection of Centre’s library in a very significant manner.</p>
