					<h2>International Guest House and Residence for the Faculty</h2>
				<p>
					As the upcoming Centre will require the services of very senior and reputed scholars, providing them congenial atmosphere and making their stay in Amritsar comfortable, suitable accommodation is required.<br>
					Presently, many of the faculty members of the Centre are living outside the campus in rented houses.<br> University bye-laws do not allow out-of-the-turn accommodation.<br>
					 In this situation the Centre must have its own residential complex besides the other buildings and infrastructure.<br>
					 Residential complex for various categories of the employees of the centre has been proposed and it will be built during the II phase of building plan.<br>
					  A Faculty House and an international Guest House of the Centre has also been proposed in the plan of the Centre.<br>
