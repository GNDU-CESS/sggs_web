							<h3>Dictionary of Gurbani</h3>
							<p>Late S. Manmohan Singh while working on the English translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, had worked on a Dictionary for finding out English words  equivalent to terminology  used in Gurbani. It has not been published. Dr. Surinder Kaur, D/o S. Manmohan Singh has approached the Centre to edit and publish it. It is a very useful piece of research to do translation of Gurbani into English. The Centre has taken up this project and work on its editing is in progress.</p>

							<h3>Up-gradation of Bibliography on Sikh Studies</h3>
							<p>The discipline of Sikh Studies which was confined only to the Punjab has come a long way and now it has become a part of University curriculum even in North America. Prof. Ganda Singh had produced a Bibliography of Sikhism way back in 1965. It is a very good and useful research tool for the scholars doing Sikh Studies. Since its first publication it has not been revised so far. Resultantly, no unified data regarding the books and research articles published in the last 50 years on Sikh Studies is available to the scholars.  The Centre has initiated a project to upgrade it in a most comprehensive manner. Hopefully it will be completed in the current session.</p>

							<h3>A Critique of Literature on Gurbani Sangeet</h3>
							<p>Gurbani Sangeet has come to us in two forms i.e. written treatises and recordings/renderings in the shape of CDs. This project has been undertaken by Bhai Baldeep Singh, Visiting Professor in the Centre. It intends to review all 
                                these forms of Gurbani Sangeet with a view to assess the developments that have taken place since its inception</p>

							<h3>Persian-Arabic Glossary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib</h3>
							<p>There are more than one thousand Persian words that have been employed by the contributors of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Without getting into the proper meanings of these words, it is very difficult to understand their occurrence and connotation in Gurbani. With the help of Dr. Amarwant Singh (formerly Professor and Head of Persian Department, Pbi. University, Patiala) the centre has worked on the Persian-Arabic Glossary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. It contains about three thousand entries wherein besides the root meanings in Persian, their occurrence in Gurbani along with their context and examples have been explained. This project is complete and it will be released at the time of inauguration of the building of the Centre.</p>

							<h3>Value System of Sri Guru Granth Sahib</h3>
							<p>The Sikh Scripture has propounded a new kind of World view which is all inclusive and holistic in nature. It stands for balance and harmony between the temporal and the spiritual known as Miri-Piri system.  The authors of Sikh Scripture had envisioned a society free from all kinds of evil where human beings may experience the Bliss of God in this very life. It required total transformation of human personality wedded to the values of highest kind. This project undertaken by Dr. Jaswinder Kaur Dhillon, Visiting Professor deals with the Value System of Sri Guru Granth Sahib from axiological perspective. To make the Hindi knowing world the ethical precepts of Sikh Scripture this work has been especially produced in Hindi. It is now under publication and will be released very shortly.</p>

							<h3>Recording of Oral Sikh Tradition and Partition of Punjab Related Stories</h3>
							<p>In order to spread the Mission of Sikhism Guru Nanak and his successors had travelled a lot in and outside the Punjab. The oral Sikh tradition that is in circulation at these places has not found its way into the written sources. To supplement as well as to corroborate the evidence, oral Sikh tradition is of great value, thus it needs recording at the earliest. Similarly, in 1947 in the wake of partition of Punjab millions of Sikhs/Punjabis had to leave their homes and hearths. Persons who have witnessed the partition and those who actually experienced it are vanishing day by day. Thus, the heart rendering stories that are enshrined in their bosoms will be lost forever. The Centre has taken upon itself to save it from oblivion. This project was initiated in collaboration with American India Foundation and 1947 Partition Archives, University of California, Berkeley. Besides appointing a Fellow the AIF provided equipment for the purpose of recording. An exhaustive questionnaire has been prepared to conduct the interview on Camera. In the current session Centre plans to publish some of the most significant interviews in a book form..</p>
